### Introduction
*change the text so its not the same*
Salinity is one of the most lethal abiotic stresses which affect multiple aspects of plant physiology. Natural variations in plant germplasm are a great resource that could be exploited for improvement in salt tolerance. Eruca sativa (E. sativa) exhibits tolerance to abiotic stresses. However, thorough evaluation of its salt stress tolerance and screening for traits that could be reliably applied for salt tolerance needs to be studied. The current study was designed to characterize 25 E. sativa accessions, originating from diverse geographical regions of Pakistan, for the salt stress tolerance.

Methods
Salt stress (150 mM NaCl) was applied for 2 weeks to the plants at four leaf stage in hydroponics. Data of the following morpho-physiological traits were collected from control and treated plants of all the accessions: root length (RL), shoot length (SL), plant height (PH), leaf number (LN), leaf area (LA), fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), chlorophyl content (SPAD), electrolyte leakage (EL), relative water content (RWC), gas exchange parameters and mineral ion content. Salt tolerance was determined based on membership function value (MFV) of the tested traits.

### Objectives and hypotheses
Our main objectives are:

1. Explore the effects of salt stress on various morpho-physiological traits in different *E. sativa* accessions. 
2. Define the susceptible and resistant accessions
3. Identify traits the salt stress has the biggest influence on
4. Compare our results with the ones from the paper

Main hypothesis:

- Susceptible accessions have statistically different morpho-physiological traits compared to their control.
- The susceptible accessions have more morpho-physiological traits affected 


### Methods 
####What have you done? And what did you use to do it? Step by step, so anyone could do it again by reading this part.
First we had to download and tidy the data. Once we have the table containing the mean values of variables for each accessions and treatments, we tested the normality of variables with shapiro.test. Then, we analysed if there is a significant difference between salt-treated and control plants for each variable. If there was normality, the analysis was performed with anova (only one variable), otherwise we used kruskal-Wallis test.

Additionaly, we did a summary table for the mean and sd of treated and control plant.

We created another table with data converted into salt tolerance index (STI): ratio of value for treated plant to control.

Then, we computed the MVF table using the formula provided in the article: **Xp=X−XminXmax−Xmin×100%**. For the traits inversely related to salt tolerance (Electrolyte leakage, Na, K, Ca) we used the second formula: **Xp=1−(X−Xmin)(Xmax−Xmin)×100%**
For calculating MFV, we used the same formula, however we used the min and max of the mean STI.


We performed the Principal Component Analysis on the MFV values of all the variables, except for RWC and ICO2 because they did not show significant difference between treatment and control. We used 8 highest ranked variables from the results: PH, SL, RL, NL, DW, FW, LA, K_Na. 

We computed the mean of MFV from MFV values of the variables above. With the results, we ranked the accessions from highly tolerant to highly sensitive. 

We still need to make the dendogram, add map with accession and check for correlation between altitude and MFV ranking.
